Hi, this is my Linux Eclipse C++,  Xorg/OpenGL Demo Application. It has been assembled from tutorials and code snippits found on the internet.

You should be able to import it directy into Eclipse C++ IDE.

I've been coding this since 2010 or so.  

Feel free to use it as you please.

It has joystick input (dual axis). You may need to remap the axis to suit your joystick. 

Dependencies:

	- pthread
	- GL
	- boost_system
	- boost_filesystem
	- GLU
	- X11
	- Xxf86vm

So you will need add the packages to your system, to compile.

Also, it uses the stb_image.h, stb_image_write.h, and stb_truetype.h libraries, for loading textures and fonts.
